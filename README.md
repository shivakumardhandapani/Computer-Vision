# EECE5639-Computer-Vision

This repository contains the project and report for the EECE 5639 Computer Vision course by Professor David Rosen at Northeastern University.

## Course Overview

This course introduces computer vision systems, combining imaging devices, computers, and sophisticated algorithms to solve problems such as autonomous navigation, human-computer interfaces, industrial inspection, medicine, image retrieval, realistic computer graphics rendering, document analysis, and remote sensing. The goal is to make useful decisions about real physical objects and scenes based on sensed images.

## Course Topics

1. Image Formation, Projective Geometry, Lighting
2. Practical Linear Algebra, Probability Review
3. Image Processing, Descriptors
4. Image Warping, Mosaicking
5. Camera Calibration
6. Stereo
7. Optical Flow
8. Tracking
9. Structure from Motion
10. Object Recognition
11. Neural Networks, Deep Learning
12. Applications

## Note

This repository is for educational purposes and showcases work completed during the course.
